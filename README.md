# Smart Home Automation Using IoT

## Getting Started

In this project we have successfully implemented voice controlled home automation system controlling relays using Arduino with Bluetooth module HC-05. This project can be used for controlling ‘n’ number of input controls (i.e) by extending number of relays.

Our implemented module is more reliable and flexible in order to control any loads and the coverage area for wireless control is 10-20 meters. Hence this project can be useful for a real time voice controlled home automation. Thus Arduino based voice controlled home appliances proves to be a better remote controlled operation on home appliances using Bluetooth module HC-05.

This project can be extended for many automation applications such as industrial automation, automotive, military, healthcare, transportation and so on. Further the coverage area can also be increased by the use of GSM modules and Wi-Fi Modules

### Dependencies
Here are some important libraries for this project to run on your local machine

```
* CH314SER
* TMRPCM
```
Both of the above dependencies help you in incorperating voice in and voice out functionalties.

### Note

The software technologies and hardware components which we used to build the project are mentioned in the report and seminar presentation clearly.
